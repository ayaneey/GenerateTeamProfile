# GenerateTeamProfiles

## Description

The purpose of this application was to generate a team profile taking in user input with the help of the Inquirer module from Node.js. Once that information was accumulated, I was able to display the information on a HTML page (rooster page) that had the embedded styles I used in my stylesheet. Overall, this project illustrates use of OOP and TDD successfully using Jest.

### Installation üõ†

<b>To install, follow the steps below:</b>

1. Ensure you have Node downloaded in your computer. To check if you already have it, in your terminal type:
   `node -v `

   This should print a version number, so you'll see something like this 'v0'. If can't see it, you can [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download Node.
   <br>

2. Go on Github and create a new repository. Change the directory to where you want to store the repository using "cd" command.
   <br>
3. Using the "git clone" command, clone the repository into your local repository. It should look something like this: <br>
   <br>
   `git clone https://github.com/ayaneey/NodeJs.git`
   <br>
4. Now you need to install the required npm packages. Run `npm init` on your terminal. This will set up or intialise a new npm package. From here, you can start using commands that should generate your readMe file. To install all dependencies, then you need to run `npm install`. Ensure you also download Inquirer.js by entering `npm install inquirer ` in your terminal.
   Good luck!üëçüèΩ
